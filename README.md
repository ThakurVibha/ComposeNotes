 # Compose Notes App  
 * My first app in Jetpack Compose with the popular clean architecture approach.
 * Basically I am folowing a youtube video to built this, but i am learning a lot and this is my fist time i stumbled upon clea architecture.
 
 # Goals to build this app:--
 
 * I want to add some more features which is not covered in this video like user can add a link of a post or article,
    if user did'nt came to note after    creating it he/she will get a notification as i obseve that we add bookmarks and we make notes but we don't ever       use them later so app should serve some meaningful purpose.
 
 * Further as soon as i complete the first versio i will publish it on playstore ðŸ˜Ž
